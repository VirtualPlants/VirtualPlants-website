Community
---------

OpenAlea is an open source project primarily aimed at the plant research community.
It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and tools that address the needs of
current and future works in Plant Architecture modeling.
OpenAlea includes modules to analyse, visualize and model the functioning and growth of plant architecture.

Project Guidelines
------------------

A project is a single unit of development in the community. It can contain a single
script to analyse some data up to a full library of models and complex tutorials
to simulate plant growth for example. No assumptions are made on the content of
a project, the programming language used or its finality.

Projects are owned by a single user but can be seen by a restricted set of users
or the whole community. They can be stored on the community versioning system, github
or any personal solution the owner choose to use.
